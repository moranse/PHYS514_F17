# PHYS 514 (Computational Physics)
University of Michigan, Fall 2017 <br>
Taught by Professor Emanuel Gull

Includes all source code for 6 homework sets on: ODE integrators, Fourier transforms, molecular dynamics, percolation, and Monte Carlo methods.

Final project replicated a 2017 paper in PRL by [Waagen *et al.*](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.96.012317), which explored explosive percolation models.

Received final grade of A+ in the class.
